The popular [R/qtl](http://www.rqtl.org) package for gene mapping has been redeveloped for high volume, multi-parent systems genetics data as [R/qtl2](http://www.rqtl.org/qtl2). This new package is still in a state of flux, so please work with us to improve.

This document concerns a suite of packages complementary to [R/qtl2](http://www.rqtl.org/qtl2) that extend capabilities in terms of plotting, fast data access, deeper probe of SNPs and structural variants, and a user-friendly interface for deep investigation. The packages are:

- [R/qtl2ggplot2](https://github.com/byandell/qtl2ggplot2)
- [R/qtl2feather](https://github.com/byandell/qtl2feather)
- [R/qtl2pattern](https://github.com/byandell/qtl2pattern)
- [R/qtl2shiny](https://github.com/byandell/qtl2shiny)

See the other packages for their own documentation. 
There are two additional packages that are more specialized and still need documentation:

- [R/DOread](https://github.com/byandell/DOread)
- [R/CausalMST](https://github.com/byandell/CausalMST)
