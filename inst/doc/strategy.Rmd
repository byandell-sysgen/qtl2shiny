```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Here is a strategy to look at multiple traits in a small interval:

- use analyses table (or other approach) to identify region of interest
    + say 1-5Mb window
- identify set of traits in region
- estimate allele effects at peak for each trait
    + useful plots?
- find best SNP(s) and pattern(s)
    + identify SDP and pattern for each
    + useful plots?
- do same for full effects
    + 36 diplotypes
    + 3-level SNPs
    
Some challenges

- don't have useful thresholds yet
- would like to think about inference across related patterns
- multiple peaks in small region
- pleiotropy vs close linkage

How to incorporate this into shiny tool?

- quick computation: limit size of region
- do we have to run genome scan?
    + or just consider flanking markers for each peak?
