I have created a (somewhat complicated) shiny app that works just fine on my laptop. I would like to deploy it on Rstudio Connect. The app.R and data (qtl2shinyData, ~65GB) are in smb://research.drive.wisc.edu/byandell in subfolder byandell/qtl2shinyApp, and some of the packages I need are in github (not yet in CRAN).
 
There are a couple of challenges:
Several packages are on github. They can be installed in app.R with:
devtools::install_github("byandell/intermediate")
devtools::install_github("byandell/qtl2mediate")
devtools::install_github("byandell/qtl2shiny")
Dataset is about 65GB and is stored on ResearchDrive
smb://research.drive.wisc.edu/byandell
subfolder byandell/qtl2shinyApp
app.R is also in this ResearchDrive folder
/Volumes/byandell/byandell/qtl2shinyApp/app.R
I cannot figure out how to access these data without having the app.R file in the same place. I presume this is some aspect of how shiny works in its own sandbox, but not sure.
 
I know how to use manifest (via rsconnect) for Rmarkdown on github, and have an idea how to do it for a shiny app (https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/user/git-backed/). I am aware of RStudio Professional Drivers (https://docs.rstudio.com/pro-drivers/) and wonder if this might be useful.

The qtl2shinyData folder is somewhat ad hoc in construction.
See the qtl2shinyData.Rmd for details.
It uses SQLite, RDS and FST for different type of information.
